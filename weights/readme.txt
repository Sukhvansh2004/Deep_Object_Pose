This folder contains the trained DOPE weights for a selection of YCB and HOPE
objects.

YCB CAD models can be downloaded from the YCB website: http://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/,
or by  using NVDU (https://github.com/NVIDIA/Dataset_Utilities); see the `nvdu_ycb` command.

We have trained weights for seven of these objects:

  YCB Object Name | Weight filename
------------------+------------------
| Bleach cleanser | bleach_28_dr.pth
| Cracker box     | cracker_60.pth
| Gelatin box     | gelatin_60.pth
| Potted meat can | meat_20.pth, net_meat_original_14.pth, net_meat_shiny_14.pth
| Mustard bottle  | mustard_60.pth
| Tomato soup can | soup_60.pth
| Sugar box       | sugar_60.pth


The HOPE dataset is located on github: https://github.com/swtyree/hope-dataset/.
The 3D models of these 28 objects can be  downloaded here:

The weights in this directory are named in the same fashion as the original 3D
models.
